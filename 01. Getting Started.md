# Getting Started

The objective of *Minimal CMake* is to walk you through the development process of taking an application from its humble beginnings (starting with a simple console application) to a complete windowed application you can demo to friends and use as a template for future projects.

We’ll see how CMake can help throughout the entire process. Perhaps the greatest benefit CMake provides is how easy it is to integrate existing open source software to improve the functionality of your app.

Before we can start using CMake to create our application, we need to ensure that we have our development environment set up and ready to go. The setup will vary depending on which platform you’ve decided to use (Windows, macOS, or Linux). We’ll cover each system here. This will provide a good starting point to build on as we introduce CMake and begin assembling the core of our application.

In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following topics:

> * Installing CMake on Windows
> * Installing CMake on macOS
> * Installing CMake on Linux (Ubuntu)
> * Installing Git
> * Visual Studio Code setup (optional)

---

## Technical requirements

To get the most out of this book, we recommend that you run the examples locally. To do this you will need the following:

> * A Windows, Mac, or Linux machine with an up-to-date operating system (OS)
> * A working C/C++ compiler (a system default is recommended for each platform if you don’t already have this)

The code examples in this chapter can be found by following this link: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Minimal-CMake.

CMake version

All examples in this book have been tested with CMake 3.28.1. Earlier versions are not guaranteed to work. Later versions should be safe to upgrade to, though it’s possible that there may be differences. If in doubt, use CMake 3.28.1 when running the examples from this book.

---

## Installing CMake on Windows

In this section, we’ll cover how to install everything you’ll need to start building applications with CMake on Windows.

To begin with, you will need a C/C++ compiler. If you don’t already have a compiler installed, a good choice to go with is Visual Studio (Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition can be downloaded from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).

Visual Studio is an integrated development environment that comes with Microsoft’s C++ compiler for Windows (`cl.exe`). We won’t be covering Visual Studio directly, though you are more than welcome to use it if you prefer (see Chapter 11, Supporting Tools and Next Steps for a brief summary). We’ll cover how to generate Visual Studio solution files and invoke MSBuild to build our project. To keep things as consistent as possible, we’ll use Visual Studio Code for most of the examples. This is more for convenience than anything else, and if you’re more comfortable with another tool, by all means use it. As CMake has grown in popularity, Visual Studio has expanded support for CMake considerably, which is worth investigating if you’re predominantly going to be developing on Windows.

Visual Studio versus Visual Studio Code

Although they sound similar, Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are two hugely different applications. Visual Studio is an integrated development environment from Microsoft that runs predominantly on Windows (there is also, confusingly, a version of Visual Studio for macOS which is quite different to the Windows application). Visual Studio is used for building Windows applications in C++ or .NET (C#, F#, and Visual Basic). Visual Studio Code on the other hand is a cross-platform code editor that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It has an extensive extension library that allows it to be used with many different programming languages. It’s popular for web development, having excellent support for TypeScript and JavaScript, though it also has robust support for C++ through the C/C++ extension from Microsoft. Visual Studio Code is what we’ll use throughout this book.

Open the Visual Studio installer and select **Visual Studio Community 2022** (if there’s a later version available when you’re reading this, feel free to grab that instead).

Figure 1.1: Visual Studio Installer version selector

After selecting **Visual Studio Community 2022**, a new panel will appear. The **Workloads** tab lets you select an option to include a set of sensible defaults. Scroll down and select **Desktop development with C++**.

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_2.jpg)<br>
Figure 1.2: Visual Studio Installer workload selector

There are several optional components selected by default on the right. It won’t hurt to leave them selected. You can remove certain features such as **Image and 3D model editors** and **Test Adapter for Boost/Google.Test** if you prefer.

After confirming your selection, click on **Install** in the bottom-right corner of the window.

Once the installation is complete, go to the Windows Start menu and follow these steps:

   Figure 1.4: Windows 11 application search results

2. Open the Terminal app. Then, from the top bar, click the dropdown and select **Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022**.

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_5.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.5: Microsoft Terminal new tab selector

   Customizing Command Prompt

   It is possible to modify the default **Command Prompt** in Windows Terminal to run `VsDevCmd.bat` when it’s launched with the host and target architectures specified. To do this, go to **Settings** from the Windows Terminal drop-down menu and then select **Open JSON file** in the lower-left corner of the screen. In the `profiles` section, find the `Command Prompt` entry under `list` and change the `commandLine` property to include the path to `VsDevCmd.bat` and the required architectures (e.g., `"commandline": "%SystemRoot%\\System32\\cmd.exe /k \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Community\\Common7\\Tools\\VsDevCmd.bat\" -arch=x64 -host_arch=x64"`). It’s also possible to call `VsDevCmd.bat` when opening Git Bash from Windows Terminal (see the *Installing Git* section if you don’t already have it installed). To do this, find **Git Bash** in the list of profiles and add the following: `"commandLine": "\"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Community\\Common7\\Tools\\VsDevCmd.bat\" -arch=x64 -host_arch=x64 && \"%PROGRAMFILES%/Git/bin/bash.exe\" -i -l"`

3. To verify that the Microsoft compiler is working as expected, run `cl.exe`. You should then see the following printed (the architecture will vary depending on the machine you’re using):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_6.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.6: Running cl.exe from Developer Command Prompt

   CMake and Visual Studio

   Visual Studio comes bundled with its own version of CMake, which you can rely on and skip the following two steps. It is located in `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin`. Running `cmake --version` will show `cmake version <version>-msvc1`, which indicates that the version is distinct from normal CMake.

4. If you do not currently have CMake installed on your system (or have a fairly old version of CMake installed), head to https://cmake.org/download/ to get the latest release (at the time of writing, this is `3.28.1`).
   
   The simplest option is to grab the Windows x64 installer (cmake-3.28.1-windows-x86_64.msi) and follow the standard installation instructions.

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_7.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.7: CMake Windows installer

5. Ensure that you select **Add CMake to the system PATH for the current user**.

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_8.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.8: CMake installer PATH options

6. Follow the remaining installation instructions and wait for CMake to install. Once this is completed, close and open Terminal and return to **Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022**.
   
   Run `cmake` and `cmake --version` and you should see the following:

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_9.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.9: Running cmake.exe from Developer Command Prompt

And with that, we’re ready to start building with CMake.

## Installing CMake on macOS

In this section, we’ll cover how to install everything you’ll need to start building the application on macOS.

To begin, you will need a C/C++ compiler. If you don’t already have a compiler installed, the safest bet is to go with Xcode, which can be downloaded from the App Store:

1. Go to **Spotlight Search** by clicking the magnifying glass on the macOS menu bar.

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_10.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.10: Spotlight Search option on macOS menu bar

2. Search for **App Store**.

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_11.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.11: Searching for App Store from Spotlight Search

3. From **App Store**, search for **Xcode**.

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_12.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.12: Xcode search results from the App Store

4. Click the **Get** and then Install buttons.

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_13.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.13: Xcode application install

   It is also possible to install **Command Line Tools** for **Xcode** from https://developer.apple.com, specifically https://developer.apple.com/download/all/, which also includes the core tools we’ll need to work with CMake. To access the Apple Developer website, an Apple Developer account is needed (you can learn more here: https://developer.apple.com/account).

5. Once either **Xcode** or **Command Line Tools for Xcode** have been installed, open the macOS Terminal app (by going to **Spotlight Search** and typing `Terminal` again) and enter the following:

   ```sh
   % clang --version
   ```

   You should see a message resembling the following:

   ```log
   Apple clang version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.3.9.4)
   ...
   ```

   This confirms that we have a working compiler and can now install CMake to work with it.

6. If you do not currently have CMake installed on your system (or have a fairly old version of CMake installed), head to https://cmake.org/download/ to get the latest release (at the time of writing this is 3.28.1).
   
   The simplest option is to grab the macOS 10.13 or later disk image (`.dmg`) (cmake-3.28.1-macos-universal.dmg) and follow the standard installation instructions.

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_14.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.14: CMake macOS installation

7. Drag **CMake** to your **Applications** folder.
   
   The CMake GUI will now be available on your system but CMake won’t yet be available from Terminal.

8. To be able to run CMake commands from Terminal, open **CMake** from the **Applications** folder, ignore the UI that appears for now, and go to the CMake macOS menu bar and click **Tools | How to install For Command Line Use**.

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_15.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.15: CMake command-line install options from macOS menu bar

9. After clicking this, a popup will appear with several options. The least invasive is likely the first option, though the second is also a fine choice.

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_16.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.16: CMake command-line install options panel

10. To have the path option persist, we need to update our `.zshrc` file.  the following line:

    ```sh
    PATH="/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin":"$PATH"
    ```

11. From Terminal, ensure you are in the home directory (`cd ~`) and then open your `.zshrc` file (feel free to do this in your favorite text editor or type `nano .zshrc` from Terminal).

    ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_17.jpg)<br>
    Figure 1.17: Opening .zshrc with nano from Terminal

12. Paste the earlier command and save the file.

    ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_18.jpg)<br>
    Figure 1.18: Modifying .zshrc from nano inside Terminal

13. To reload the Zsh config file and update the `PATH` variable, run `source .zshrc`.

    ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_19.jpg)<br>
    Figure 1.19: Refresh the Terminal environment by executing .zshrc again

14. Finally, run `cmake` from Terminal to verify that it can be found.

    ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_20.jpg)<br>
    Figure 1.20: Running cmake from Terminal

    You can also use `where cmake` and `cmake --version` to verify that you have the correct version installed.

With that, we’re ready to start building with CMake.

## Installing CMake on Linux (Ubuntu)

In this section, we’ll cover how to get everything you’ll need to start building the application on Linux (Ubuntu).

To begin with, you will need a C/C++ compiler. If you don’t already have a compiler installed, an excellent choice is to go with GCC. This can be installed by using the standard Ubuntu package manager, `apt`:

1. Open **Terminal** by using **Show Applications** from the desktop.

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_21.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.21: Ubuntu Show Applications menu option

2. Run `sudo apt update` and then `sudo apt install build-essential` (it is possible that your version of Ubuntu already comes with this installed, but it’s good to check).
   
   ```sh
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential
   ```

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_22.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.22: Installing build-essential from Terminal

3. Run `gcc --version` to verify that the compiler can be found and is working as expected. You should see output resembling the following:

   ```sh
   gcc (Ubuntu 11.4.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.4.0 ...
   ```

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_23.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.23: Running gcc --version from Terminal

4. Next, we need to install CMake. This can be done via a package manager (e.g., `apt`), but we’ll do so directly here to specify the precise version. Go to https://cmake.org/download/ and scroll down to find the binary distributions section. Grab Linux x86_64 (Intel) (`cmake-3.28.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`) or Linux aarch64 (ARM) (`cmake-3.28.1-linux-aarch64.tar.gz`) depending on your architecture.

5. Run this command from the folder you downloaded CMake to extract and install CMake to your `/opt` folder:

   ```sh
   sudo tar -C /opt -xzf cmake-3.28.1-linux-aarch64.tar.gz
   ```

   (It’s perfectly reasonable to extract the files to a local folder and update your `PATH` variable to point to the bin folder. Installing to `/opt` is one common approach).

6. You can alternatively just double-click the `tar.gz` file and use the **Archive Manager Extract** option:
   
   1. Click the **Extract** option and then go to **Other Locations | Computer** and select the **opt** folder.
   
   2. Then click **Extract** again in the top-right corner.

      ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_24.jpg)<br>
      Figure 1.24: Ubuntu Archive Manager Extract dialog

7. Go to your home directory (`cd ~`) and enter `nano .bashrc`.

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_25.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.25: Opening .bashrc with nano from Terminal

8. Add the `bin` subfolder in the directory you extracted in your `/opt` folder to your `PATH` variable with the following line:

   ```sh
   PATH="/opt/cmake-3.28.1-linux-aarch64/bin":"$PATH"
   ```

   (The architecture may differ in your specific case, such as by having `cmake-3.28.1-linux-x86_64` instead of `cmake-3.28.1-linux-aarch64`).

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_26.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.26: Modifying .bashrc from nano inside Terminal

9. With that, save the file and close nano (`Ctrl+O, Ctrl+X`). Then run `source .bashrc` to reload the `.bashrc` file and update the `PATH` variable in the current Terminal session.

10. Finally, type `cmake` and hit return to confirm that things are working as expected. You should see the following printed:

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_27.jpg)<br>
   Figure 1.27: Running cmake from Terminal

11. As a last step, run `sudo apt-get install libgles2-mesa-dev` to ensure you have the dependencies needed to run some of the later examples in the book.
    
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install libgles2-mesa-dev
    ```

    With that, we’re ready to start building with CMake.

---

## Installing Git

To follow the examples provided in each chapter and retrieve the accompanying source code for this book (available from the book’s website https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Minimal-CMake), it is recommended to have Git installed on your system.

The easiest way to do this is to go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and download Git for your chosen platform if you do not already have it installed.

On macOS, Git is installed as part of the Xcode installation we walked through in *Installing CMake on macOS*. On Windows, download the 64-bit installer and run the installation. On Linux (Ubuntu), run `sudo apt-get install git` from the terminal.

```sh
sudo apt-get install git
```

Type `git` from the command line to verify that the tool is available.

---

## Visual Studio Code setup (optional)

To ensure a consistent experience throughout the book, Visual Studio Code will be used along with the native terminal to walk through code examples, be that on Windows, macOS, or Linux. The following section outlines how to get set up with Visual Studio Code and configure your development environment. If you would prefer to use a different editor, that’s fine. All that is needed to follow along is a C/C++ compiler and CMake. Visual Studio Code is simply used as a cross-platform editor (it also comes with some excellent CMake support that is covered in Chapter 11, *Supporting Tools and Next Steps*).

To install Visual Studio Code, go to https://code.visualstudio.com/Download. There are links for Windows, Linux, and macOS there. Follow the installation instructions for your platform of choice. On Windows, choose **User Installer** and follow the setup instructions.

On Linux, either download the .deb package and use the **Software Install** application or download the `code-stable-...tar.gz` file and extract it to `/opt` similarly to how we extracted CMake (e.g., `sudo tar -C /opt -xzf code-stable-arm64-1702460949.tar.gz`). After extracting it, add `/opt/VSCode-linux-<arch>/bin` to your path by updating your `.bashrc` file again.

```sh
sudo tar -C /opt -xzf code-stable-arm64-1702460949.tar.gz
```

On Mac, download the `.zip` file, extract it, and then drag and drop the **Visual Studio Code** application into your **Applications** folder (this can be done from **Finder**).

One point to mention is that it’s helpful to ensure that Visual Studio Code is added to your `PATH` so it can be opened easily from the command line (using `code .` from your project or workspace folder). This can be done as part of the installation wizard on Windows or by updating `.bashrc` on Linux. On macOS, there is a way to do this from within Visual Studio Code. Open Visual Studio Code and press either F1, *Shift + Cmd + P* (macOS) or press *Shift + Ctrl + P* for Windows or Linux. Alternatively, from the menu bar, you can click **View | Command Palette**. Once the command palette is open, type `shell`. The action **“Shell Command: Install ‘code’ command in PATH”** will display. A popup will appear prompting **osascript** to make changes to the system. Confirm this by entering your user password and then open an instance of Terminal to verify that Visual Studio Code can be started by running `code`.

Once Visual Studio Code is installed and up and running, navigate to the **Extensions** option on the left panel and search for `C/C++ extension pack`.

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835087312/graphics/image/B21152_01_28.jpg)<br>
Figure 1.28: Extensions view in Visual Studio Code

The **C/C++ Extension Pack** extension comes with the C/C++ extension, which supplies IntelliSense and debugging features. The extension pack also includes CMake language support and CMake Tools, a CMake integration for Visual Studio Code.

Now that we have Visual Studio Code installed, we can guarantee a consistent experience when developing across all platforms. Using Visual Studio Code is completely optional, but it is highly recommended. In Chapter 11, *Supporting Tools and Next Steps*, we’ll show you how CMake and Visual Studio Code complement one another.

---

## Summary

In this chapter, we walked through everything you need to begin development with CMake. We installed a C/C++ compiler on Windows, macOS, and Linux and installed CMake on each platform. We saw how to install Git and walked through how to install Visual Studio Code and enable several useful extensions. Having our environment configured correctly is important to ensure that the later examples we’ll work through behave as expected. We now have everything we need to start using CMake and can start developing our project to understand how CMake can accelerate how we build software.

In the next chapter, we will introduce CMake and look at the commands you will commonly run from the terminal. We’ll also look at some of the core commands that make up a CMake script. We’ll get a basic application up and running and learn about generators, build types, and more.
